This repository demonstrates a problem encountered while building an Expo project using Expo CLI.  After updating a dependency that utilizes `react-native-web`, a vague error involving `metro-resolver` was encountered. The error message itself provides little insight into the root cause of the issue. This repository provides the problematic code (bug.js) and a potential solution (bugSolution.js). The solution involves carefully checking package dependencies and potentially using the Expo Go app to help debug the issue.  The issue highlights the challenges of debugging vague errors within the Expo ecosystem.
