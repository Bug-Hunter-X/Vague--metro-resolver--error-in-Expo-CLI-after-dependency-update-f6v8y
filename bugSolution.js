The solution to the problem turned out to be related to conflicting package versions.  A careful examination of the `package.json` file and its dependencies revealed an incompatibility between `react-native-web` and a newly added dependency. Resolving this involved either downgrading the new library or ensuring all `react-native-web`-related packages are compatible.  Using the Expo Go app to test changes iteratively was also incredibly helpful in pinpointing the problematic dependency.  Additionally, ensuring the correct peer dependencies are installed and that the versions are compatible across all packages can resolve many of these cryptic errors.
